  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Maya Ashfour and I am a senior at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently majoring in Arts, Humanities and Technology General, with a focus in UX/UI Design. As an AHT  major, it is vital for me to learn new design skills for the real world. I hope to grow and acquire a strong level of confidence for future experiences and opportunities. I have always been an outgoing person, and I've learned how important confidence is for any job you undertake. I have found and grown a love for meeting and interacting with new people in a way where both I and the person I'm talking to feel one hundred percent safe. I believe it is essential for anyone, regardless of their major, to develop effective speaking skills and be able to navigate life without feeling fearful.
