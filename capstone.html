  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>To address this challenge, we designed a mobile app specifically for Fischer Investments that supports students and recent graduates during their transition into the workforce. We called it 'Compass Connect'. The app focuses on reducing anxiety by providing guidance, structure, and connection. By combining mentorship, career resources, and scheduling tools into one intuitive platform, the app helps users feel supported and informed as they take their first steps into their professional careers. Our solution emphasizes accessibility, clarity, and reassurance, creating a smoother transition from school life to the workplace.</p>

  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>Our research included exploring existing studies and articles about post-graduation anxiety and early-career stress. Research shows that many recent graduates experience imposter syndrome, fear of failure, and uncertainty about professional norms when entering the workforce. Studies also indicate that access to mentorship and clear career guidance significantly reduces anxiety and improves confidence among early-career professionals. Additionally, research highlighted that structured support systems, such as career planning tools and networking opportunities, help graduates feel more prepared and engaged. These findings reinforced the importance of building an app that prioritizes mentorship, organization, and transparent communication.</p>

  <h3>Interviews</h3>
  <p>Applicants were being ignored and rejected due to lack of experience. These factors lead to more anxiety and disconnect within the job process.
We conducted interviews with soon to be graduates or current graduates who are in the job market. 
We learned that applicants sought connections and worried about being the proper fit for a job. 
Responses from interviewee's includes, "Don’t just apply, also make connections and network too", "Being rejected makes it hard to keep going”, “Will this role support my journey and long-term goals?”, and Applying is not enough, networking is a must."
